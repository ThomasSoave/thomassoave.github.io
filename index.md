Hello my name is Thomas Soave, I'm a dedicated Junior IT Technician. I seek to empower those around me with knowledge, kindness, and great customer service. I've had a knack for technology my whole life. Exploring, learning and problem solving.   In 2019 I went to college to further educate myself in the IT field graduating with honors and completing an education based internship where I worked for a major Computer Distributor. I have been commended for my insight into unique technical issues and my hard work in resolving and providing a never quit attitude.  I will bring not only my technical insight to a position but my natural ability to connect with people and my positive understanding of different environments and situations.
